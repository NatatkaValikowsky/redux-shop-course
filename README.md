## Project description

This small shop was developed by me during the course of Redux. This code has been written from the sample, and I'm going to make a few of improvements.

## List of improvements

1. Add a mock data from API (mocky.io)
2. Change approach to get absolute paths in app (now there is a node_modules folder in src, its not a good idea)
3. Small code refactoring

Maybe I'll develop backend for this app.
